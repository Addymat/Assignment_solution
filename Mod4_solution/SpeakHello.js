// STEP 2: Wrap the entire contents of SpeakHello.js inside of an IIFE
// See Lecture 52, part 2


// STEP 3: Create an object, called 'helloSpeaker' to which you will attach
// the "speak" method and which you will expose to the global context
// See Lecture 52, part 1
// var helloSpeaker =

// DO NOT attach the speakWord variable to the 'byeSpeaker' object.
(function (window) {
    var ifnj = {};
    ifnj.speakWord = "Hello";
    
    // STEP 8: Rewrite the 'speak' function such that it is attached to the
    // byeSpeaker object instead of being a standalone function.
    // See Lecture 52, part 2
     ifnj.speak = function (arg) {
      console.log(ifnj.speakWord + " " + arg);
    }

// STEP 5: Expose the 'helloSpeaker' object to the global scope. Name it
// 'helloSpeaker' on the global scope as well.
// See Lecture 52, part 2
// (Note, Step 6 will be done in the SpeakGoodBye.js file.)
// xxxx.xxxx = helloSpeaker;
